'Top 10 Things Every Software Engineer Should Know' 대해 생각을 정리한 글입니다.

## 3. 각 개발 패러다임 별로 하나의 언어를 익히자.
The discussion what is the best programming language has a religious character, it’s more a question of belief. I don’t like to preach my personal belief about the bestlanguageshere, but one thing is important: “Learn more programming languages, at least one for each mainstream development paradigms.”

* procedural programming languages (C, COBOL, PL/I, FORTAN, etc.)
* object-oriented programming languages (Smalltalk, Java, C++, etc.)
* functional programming languages (Erlang, Clojure, F#, etc.)
* declarative programming languages(SQL, XSLT, regular expressions, etc.)

Its a good idea to know at least one multi-paradigm programming languages like Python, Java, C++ or C#. You find many listsof programming languages by type or other categoriesin the web [2].
Dependent of your industry, personal preferences and daily tasks you should select your individual top 1o list of programming languages. Learn them and try to use at least 3 of them on a regular base. The old saying “If your only tool is a hammer, all your problems will look like nails” is particularly true for development paradigms.
